    "### What Makes Sequential2D Special?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential2D isn't just another way to implement Sequential networks. It enables entirely new architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Parallel Paths**: Data can flow through several paths simultaneously\n",
    "2. **Skip Connections**: Information can jump across multiple layers\n",
    "3. **Complex Connectivity**: Non-linear data flow patterns impossible with Sequential\n",
    "4. **Block Matrix Structure**: Think of your network as a 2D grid of computational blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "These capabilities allow you to implement architectures like:\n",
    "- ResNet-style skip connections\n",
    "- Multi-path networks (like Inception)\n",
    "- Dynamical systems with feedback loops\n",
    "- Networks with complex information flow patterns\n",
